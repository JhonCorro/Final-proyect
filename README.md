## 1. Title (might be changed)
Data extraction system by means of image processing and variable correlation.

## 2. Problem
Many companies focused on refrigeration, with machines that regulate temperature in closed environments, do not have an internal control 
system for their mechanisms. The current process they use for data collection consists of an operator who, at certain intervals of time,
records the information shown on the screens of the devices in a spreadsheet. This situation causes the company to lose money due to the
poor regulation of their systems and they see the need to invest in a control model.

## 3. Justification
Due to the above, there is the need a system that can obtain this data and analyze it in a simple and comfortable way for the company. 
The data provided by the systems are shown by a display, therefore, the proposed methodology consists in the installation of a webcam that 
focuses on that display. In this way you can monitor the data without having the need to have hardware inside the company with the 
exception of the camera and a small computer system. By means of image analysis it is possible to obtain numerical and non-numerical 
values, and finally send them to a web server where the correlation and analysis of data would be performed.

## 4. Objectives
  * ### General
      1.  Design and implement a platform that allows the acquisition and correlation of data for a York brand, model 2012, cooling system.
  * ### Specifics
      1.  Design and implement a system for data monitoring through a webcam.
      2.  Design and implement a system that extracts the variables through image processing.
      3.  Implement a system for sending variables to a server through the Internet.
      4.  Design and implement a system for variables' correlation.
      5.  Design and implement a system correlations' visualization.
